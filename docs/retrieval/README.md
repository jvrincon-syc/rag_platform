# Retrieval

## 1. Purpose and scope

Retrieval validates a consumer-scoped lane, embeds queries with the exact durable profile, searches active vector rows, and uses lexical fallback only under policy. It returns evidence with document, child/parent, page/section, profile, corpus, and bundle provenance.

## 2. Current branch state

This reflects committed `main` at `f918b512a5320b6fc434feefe1e3e9f780bc097b`. No retrieval README existed in that commit. The durable retrieval profile table comes from `migrations/20260805_13_create_retrieval_profiles.sql`.

## 3. Code map

- Domain profiles, errors, and evidence: `app/back/src/retrieval/domain/`.
- Lifecycle, readiness, query embeddings, and search: `app/back/src/retrieval/application/`.
- API: `app/back/src/retrieval/api/` under `/api/retrieval`.
- PostgreSQL/in-memory adapters: `app/back/src/retrieval/infrastructure/`.
- Fusion and default reranking: `app/back/src/retrieval/fusion.py` and `app/back/src/retrieval/reranking.py`.
- Tests: `app/back/tests/retrieval/`.

## 4. Inputs and outputs

A profile binds consumer scope, corpus version, embedding profile, indexing target, and lexical policy. Search consumes that resolved profile, query, and `top_k`; it never accepts a client-supplied vector table. It returns `RetrievedEvidence` with source, score, location, profile/corpus, and vector bundle identity when available.

## 5. Operational flow

1. Create an inactive profile after proving profile/target compatibility.
2. Validate using a synthetic smoke query, then activate only when ready.
3. Readiness requires an active/validated profile, a usable query engine, a compatible target, and active rows from at least one indexed document.
4. Resolve the query engine, vector-search the exact target/profile/corpus lane, then enrich each ranked match with any missing parent context without inflating the `top_k` result count.
5. On query embedding failure, use lexical-only search only when policy permits; otherwise block.

## 6. Rules and invariants

- `retrieval_profiles` is the activation authority; vector `is_active` is a projection.
- A usable profile is active, validated, and not deprecated; one active profile exists per scope/corpus.
- Target table and metric must match the embedding profile.
- PostgreSQL vector and lexical searches restrict evidence to processed, approved documents.
- Zero active vector rows block readiness; multiple active bundles are valid when they represent different documents in the same corpus lane. Policy `never` forbids lexical-only answers.

## 7. Critical variables and configuration

- `SST_FEATURE_RETRIEVAL_V1` gates profile creation and activation routes;
  `retrieval_v1` is the internal resolved flag field.
- `lexical_fallback_policy` is `allowed_when_vector_unavailable`, `never`, or `always`; committed fallback is reached on query-embedding failure.
- `RETRIEVAL_VALIDATOR_VERSION=retrieval-validator-v1`; the smoke query is synthetic.
- Query engine semantics are resolved through the embedding registry.

## 8. Logs, manifests, and observability

Lifecycle code emits shared typed events and readiness is durable in `readiness_checks`. Use [current-contracts.md](../observability/current-contracts.md) for destinations and redaction. Do not log queries, evidence text, vectors, secrets, or provider bodies.

## 9. Commands and verification

```powershell
npm run test:retrieval
npm run test:pipeline
```

Focused coverage includes bundle-first end-to-end, API lifecycle, fusion/reranking, and isolation audits.

## 10. Visible inconsistencies and debt

- The observability snapshot omits a retrieval event family despite shared event emission.

## 11. Missing pieces to reach the target model

- No retrieval CLI/runbook covers smoke validation, policy decisions, failure, or rollback.
- Answer generation and citation verification are outside this module and have no implemented handoff documented here.
